<<Instructions>>

You are the captain of Frank, a treasure-hunting ship. Your  current mission
is to use sonar devices to find three sunken treasure chests at the bottom of
the ocean. But you only have cheap sonars that find distance not direction. 
Enter the coordinates to drop a sonar device. The ocean map will be marked with
how far away the nearest chest is, or an X if it is beyond the sonar device's
range. For example, the 'C' marks are where chests are. The sonar device shows
a 3 because the cloest chect is three spaces away.
